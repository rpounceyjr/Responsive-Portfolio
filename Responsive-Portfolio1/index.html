                <p>Roger Pouncey is a musician and aspiring developer based in Richmond, VA. Roger has been playing
                    guitar for 20 years. In 2015 he graduated Summa Cum Laude from VCU’s Jazz Studies program with a
                    Bachelor of Music Performance. While at VCU, Roger had the opportunity to play with a wide variety
                    of visiting artists including bassist and Mingus Big Band leader Boris Kozlov, Vanguard Orchestra
                    saxophonist Dick Oatts, Maria Schneider Orchestra saxophonist Steve Wilson, and percussionist Efrain
                    Toro. During his time at VCU, Roger garnered many awards and scholarships, including the Gin
                    Robertson Scholarship and the Richmond Jazz Society’s Joseph J. Kennedy Junior Jazz music
                    scholarship.

                <p>Roger was chosen two years in a row to take part in a partnership with the University of
                    Kwazulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. The program brought together one small ensemble each from VCU
                    and UKZN to compose and perform original music that explored the United States’ and South Africa’s
                    shared history of racism and the civil rights. The program culminated in performances by both groups
                    on stages in the United States and Durban, South Africa. Roger is also a composer and arranger,
                    having written for, among others, the aforementioned exchange program, VCU’s Jazz Orchestras, and
                    his own groups. Most recently Roger was commissioned to arrange a big band piece for
                    Grammy-Award-Winning percussionist John Santos.

                <p>In 2019, Roger decided to pursue a career change that would allow him more time with his family. He
                    began self-teaching web development using online resources such as Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp. His
                    interest grew quickly, and it soon became apparent that a career as a developer would be a wonderful
                    alternative to babysitting teaching. In 2020, Roger enrolled in the University of Richmond Coding
                    Boot Camp program.

                <p>
                    While Roger looks to a career in web development to replace certain aspects of the professional
                    musician life, he still intends to pursue musical activities that interest him, such as writing and
                    performing. Roger performs regularly throughout the region as both a sideman and a leader. He leads
                    the jazz trio every Sunday at the Jefferson Hotel brunch.
